## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
## 1.Personality Profiling: 
Create a simulation that assesses applicants' personality traits, values, and motivations. Selectors can use this information to determine the best fit for their organization.
## 2.Virtual Interview Platform: 
Create a simulated interview environment where applicants can practice responding to common interview questions. Selectors can review and provide feedback on the applicants' responses.
## 3.Realistic Job Preview: 
Create a simulation that gives applicants a realistic view of the job requirements, responsibilities, and work environment. This helps selectors identify applicants who are genuinely interested in the role.
## 4. Feedback and Development: 
Provide applicants with personalized feedback and development plans based on their performance in the simulation. Selectors can use this information to identify areas for improvement.
## 5.AI-Powered Insights: 
Use artificial intelligence to analyze applicant data and provide selectors with actionable insights, such as candidate rankings, skill gaps, or potential biases.
